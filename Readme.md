# Welcome to StroggForge
The backbone of any software engineering team worth its salt in the modern age is its CI. We live and die on the deliverability and reliability of our applications.
Thus, exists the StroggForge. DreamWeave's various repositories all depend on this repository to some capacity or another. 
Custom actions are built here which are used to sign and ship our applications.

Additionally, one may also find information relating to the DreamWeave organizational hierarchy and a map of DreamWeave repositories and distribution facilities.
`DreamWeave Map.drawio` and `DreamWeave Map.png` both describe the layout of DreamWeave's various repositories, external sources, and distribution platforms our applications and dependencies pipe out to.
